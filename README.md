  Jennifer Hornig personal website
</h1>

A portfolio website to showcase my projects as a web designer and frontend developer with focus on JavaScript, React and the Jamstack architecture.

It is built using React and Gatsby and deployed on Netlify.

The website is live at <a href="https://www.jenniferhornig.com">jenniferhornig.com</a>.
